A programmer at heart, I am very interested in making a good softwares that are easy to maintain and scalable. I have several experiences writing code in languages that have dynamic/static typing, and strong/weak typing. At first, I learned about object-oriented programming and design patterns related to it because that's all everybody know and use. But then I found alternative approach to design software using functional programming and it open a new world for me.:w

I am a poor writer and speaker that's why I use this blog for my training medium. I occasionally will write in Indonesian language (aka bahasa Indonesia).
